This is my final project. It is a twist on the tweet manager but instead it is a password manager much like 1Password or LastPass but much more simple. To get started with this application make sure to use the admin password 12345 to enter the manager. If you don't then it will allow you to try again until you do enter it correctly. This application also will save your passwords using pickle in a file called "data.pkl" and then will load your sites and passwords when you run the project again. There is already an example on there and I'm pretty sure you'll be able to tell which one that is.
